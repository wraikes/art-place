# Summary
- This exercise is designed to help you approach, and love, merge conflict resolution.

## Exercise Three
- Similar to exercise 2, update the color for at least one column that you updated on the `atomic-commits` branch. Make sure that it's different than whatever you changed that column to within the `atomic-commits` branch.
- Want a challenge? Feel comfortable with merge conflicts? Update multiple columns.
- Want a greater challenge? Update individual rows within each column and try to make the gnarliest merge conflict that you can. Then resolve it.
- Add and commit your change to the branch.
- Type `git merge atomic-commits` in the CLI.
- Resolve the conflicts.

We'll be covering the steps of merge conflict resolution live, but here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMTDFMwU3sU&list=PLg7s6cbtAD16Pgp6WIVfX4VsGI-xyWkMz&index=11) of a resolution if you're following along outside of a workshop.


## Next Steps
- Close any open items in your text editor.
- Type `git checkout gallery` and follow the instructions in the `instructions.md`
